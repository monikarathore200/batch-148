                <p>
             becoming India’s no. 1 fashion destination is not an easy feat. 
             Sincere efforts, digital enhancements and a team of dedicated personnel with
              an equally loyal customer base have made Myntra the online platform that it
               is today. The original B2B venture for personalized gifts was conceived in
                2007 but transitioned into a full-fledged ecommerce giant within a span of 
                just a few years. By 2012, Myntra had introduced 350 Indian and 
                international brands to its platform, and this has only grown in number
                 each passing year. Today Myntra sits on top of the online fashion game
                  with an astounding social media following, a loyalty program dedicated 
                  to its customers, and tempting, hard-to-say-no-to deals.

                    Another reason why Myntra is the best of all online stores is the 
                    complete convenience that it offers. You can view your favourite brands
                     with price options for different products in one place. A user-friendly
                      interface will guide you through your selection process. Comprehensive
                       size charts, product information and high-resolution images help you
                        make the best buying decisions. You also have the freedom to choose
                         your payment options, be it card or cash-on-delivery. The 14-day 
                         returns policy gives you more power as a buyer. Additionally, the
                          try-and-buy option for select products takes customer-friendliness
                           to the next level.
            Enjoy the hassle-free experience as you shop comfortably from your home or
             your workplace. You can also shop for your friends, family and loved-ones
              and avail our gift services for special occasions.
